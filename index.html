        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Bridgette Murphy. I am currently a second year here at University of California, Riverside. I love my campus and have been actively involved in many clubs and organizations for as long as I have been here. I am a hard worker, someone who cares very deeply about those around her, loves to help whenever she can, and is always ready for a new adventure. For my first job I worked at Olive Garden as a host. This a great first job because it gave me an awesome opportunity to learn what a real job was like. My main task was to seat guest and greet them as they would walk through the doors. This was a very important job because we were the first faces that these customers saw so to them we were the face of the company. This job taught me so many lessons about customer service and how to help customers with whatever they need. We also were in charge of cleaning the bathrooms so this was a good chance for me to learn about custodial duties so that now I have them in my back pocket if I ever need them at another job. What I loved most about this job was that I got to meet so many amazing and nice people every day. The next job I had was at the UCR dinning hall as a student server. <br><br>

        I am a team player that wants to hear everyone’s ideas because I truly feel like everyone has something important to say. Making people feel like their voices are being heard and understood is so important because it builds better comradery within a company because people feel as though they can trust the people they work with and that those people actually want to hear what they have to say. I was also a girl scout growing up. For as long as I can remember I was learning about sharing and being kind and compassionate within girl scouts. It taught me so many important life skills. For example, being nice to those around you. When you are nice to those around you people recognize this and want to also be nice. If you project the energy you want to see in the world that energy will come back to you. I also know a lot of online systems like Word and PowerPoint so I would be able to make presentation and have a good understanding of how to use all of that. I also am quite good on Canva. <br><br>

        I can create flyers or social media messages for the brand and have lots of creative ideas to help make the company better. I am so excited to have you reading my resume I hope you like it and that we will be able to talk soon. Please feel free to contact me at 12345678 as this is the most accessible phone number I have. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my resume.
